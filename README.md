# PSR auto-formatting for NetBeans

Provides import-able configuration settings for PSR1/PSR2 standards. Although NetBeans does not provide automatic formatting support for all of the PSR1 and PSR2 standards (eg. refactoring class and method names), where possible I have implemented the new line, braces positioning, spaced tabs etc. When using the ```Source > Format``` function in NetBeans the PHP code will automatically be formatted to match PSR1/2 syntax format.

## Requirements

* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) (Tested and developed on v8.0.2 but should work fine on other versions too!)

## License

These configuration settings files are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Support

I am happy to provide support via. my personal email address, so if you need a hand drop me an email at: [mailto:ballen@bobbyallen.me](ballen@bobbyallen.me).

## Installation

TBC

## Preparing the source code for 'import'

In order to import the settings into NetBeans, compress the root directory of the ```src``` directory into a .ZIP file of which can then be used to import into NetBeans as shown below in the installation guide.
